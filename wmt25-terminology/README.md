## Report
You can find the whole description of the data, systems, metrics and results [here](https://www2.statmt.org/wmt25/pdf/2025.wmt-1.30.pdf)!

## Data

- the test sets (incl. source, reference, and terminology constraints) are placed in [ranking/references](ranking/references)
- the submitted system outputs are placed in [ranking/submissions](ranking/submissions)

## Evaluation

- the codes for metrics can be found in:
  - [ranking/metric_track1](ranking/metric_track1) and [ranking/metric_track2](ranking/metric_track2) folders (main evaluation: general quality X term success rate)
  - the additional metrics can be found in the [respective folder](additional_metrics):
    - [term-consistency](additional_metrics/term-consistency) folder for terminology consistency metric
    - [fsp](additional_metrics/fsp) folder for FSP 

The table shows results for **three modes of terminology**: `Proper`, `Random` and `NoTerm` for proper, random terms or no terms at all.

We used three metrics to rank the systems:

1. **General MT Quality**: measured with ChrF (to be consistent with both sentence- and document-level translation, since the neural metrics are not working well on long documents). Represented by the columns `ChrF`.
2. **Terminology Success Rate** measures the percentage of the proper term translations in the system outputs. Represented by `Acc` columns. **NB:** In all three modes, the measured terms are the proper terms, i.e. the output of the `random` mode or `noterm` mode is still compared against the proper terms.
3. **Term consistency**: measures how consistent the translations of the terms are, irrespective of whether they are correct. Represented by `Cons.` columns. **NB:** Analogously to success rate, the terms for all three modes are proper terms.

You can see two tables with main statistics:

 - **Table 6** shows the results of the Track1 (sentence-level MT). For systems that provided all three translation directions, it shows an average score of them (scores for each direction are shown in small numbers, target languages are denoted, source language is `En` in all cases).
 - **Table 7** shows the results of the Track2 (document-level MT). The results are averaged scores of 5 texts for each translation direction. 

## Plotting results

- To generate LaTeX code for the tables, run `python3 visualization/plot_table_track1.py; python3 visualization/plot_table_track2.py`
- To generate tradeoff figures, run `python3 visualization/plot_tradeoff.py`
- To generate the effect of terminology mode, run `python3 visualization/plot_effect_termmode.py`
